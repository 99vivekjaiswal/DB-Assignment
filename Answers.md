1)The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is one-to-many. This means that a single product category can have many products associated with it, but a single product can only belong to one category.

2)There are two ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:

Foreign Key Constraint: You can create a foreign key constraint on the "Product" table's "Product_Category" column that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. 
                        This would prevent any products from being inserted into the "Product" table with an invalid category ID.

Not Null Constraint: You can create a NOT NULL constraint on the "Product" table's "Product_Category" column. This would ensure that the column cannot be left blank, but it would not prevent invalid category IDs from being inserted.
